# PixyCheck
Dead pixel testing application.

This is a simple double tap to change color application. It was my first Android application that I published on Playstore. 

My goal was to:
- Learn ins and out of using Google play developer console
- Learn how to shorten the size of an app as much as possible
- Learn how to handle user support
